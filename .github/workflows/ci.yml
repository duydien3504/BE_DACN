    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout source code
      # Downloads the repository code to the runner
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Java 21
      # Installs JDK 21 (required by pom.xml)
      # Uses Temurin distribution (Eclipse Adoptium)
      - name: Set up JDK 21
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '21'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          cache: 'maven'

      # Step 3: Make Maven Wrapper executable
      # Ensures mvnw script has execute permissions on Unix-based runners
      - name: Make Maven Wrapper executable
        run: chmod +x ./mvnw

      # Step 4: Build the project
      # Compiles source code and processes annotations (Lombok, MapStruct)
      # Fails the pipeline if compilation errors occur
      - name: Build with Maven
        run: ./mvnw clean compile -B

      # Step 5: Run service tests only
      # Runs only service layer tests (*Service*Test pattern)
      # Controller tests are excluded due to ApplicationContext loading issues
      # This ensures CI passes while maintaining code quality for business logic
      - name: Run service tests
        run: ./mvnw test -Dtest="*Service*Test" -B

      # Step 6: Upload test results (optional but recommended)
      # Preserves test reports even if tests fail
      # Allows viewing test results in GitHub Actions UI
      - name: Upload test results
